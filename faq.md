### WHO IS THIS APP DESIGNED FOR? ###

It is designed for senior medical students, interns or junior residents (or anything that comes immediately after med school in your country). It makes the assumption that you have good general medical knowledge. It applies commonly used medical abbreviations / acronyms to lighten the text.


### ARE THERE ANY ACTIVATION OR RENEWAL FEES? ###

No. You buy it and it’s yours (unlike some other popular medical resources…)

### DO YOU PLAN ON UPDATING IT? ###

Yes. Updates will always be free.

### IS THE INFORMATION PEER REVIEWED? ###

Yes. We do our best to provide accurate medical information. If you find any errors in the text, email us and we’ll do our best to correct it ASAP.

### I BOUGHT THE IOS VERSION OF THE APP AND I JUST BOUGHT A NEW ANDROID DEVICE (OR VICE-VERSA); DO I NEED TO BUY THE APP AGAIN? ###

Unfortunately, there is no way of transferring platforms without paying for the app again.
