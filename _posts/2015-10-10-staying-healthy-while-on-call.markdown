Every once in a while, we must be reminded of what exactly is health. As you probably know by now, health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

(WHO definition). As a resident, your job is to make people healthy. Unfortunately, because of many confounding factors, residency can be a very unhealthy part of a physician’s life. We must be careful to not let it get out of hand.

## Eating

Let’s face it. Hospital food tends to be on the tasteless part of the taste spectrum. If it’s tasty, it probably spent some time in the deep fryer and we all know how healthy that is. I personally never been the guy to bring lunches from home when I was on call, but I would make a conscious decision on the quality of the food I’d get from the cafeteria. That’s easier said than done. For one, we tend to associate food with reward: “I’m on call and I’ll work hard tonight, therefore I deserve those french fries”. That’s a bad habit we should all get rid of, but again, easier said than done. Moreover, as you quickly learn, food tastes SO much better at 3AM. Chips? Chocolate bar? They are tasty to begin with, but in the middle of the night, it’s almost as if they could replace your bed.

What that can lead to, after a few years of hard work, is a nice little belly. You don’t want to be calculating a Framingham score on yourself don’t you?

I recommend bringing easy to carry food with you in your “on call bag”, such as

- almonds / trail mix
- apple
- banana
- baby carrots

There’s probably more that doesn’t come to mind. You should come up with your own solution, but just knowing about the problem is a good first step.

## Move!

Many people think that since they’re running all over the hospital, that must be good enough to get in the minimum recommended daily activity. [http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_adults/en/](http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_adults/en/) We all know that what is considered “recommended daily activity” changes every other week, but ultimately, we rarely do that. If you doubt, just get a pedometer or one of the wearables (Fitbit, Nike FuelBand, Polar Loop, Apple Watch…) and see for yourself.

During residency, I picked up running more regularly. I’m not a big runner: maybe 30 min 2-3 times a week, but it’s better than nothing! I like running because you can easily bring your equipment with you and you can do it almost anywhere. I didn’t have to drive to exercise so I was able to go on a heartbeat. Running is not for everyone, I know, but I strongly encourage you to find a sport that will keep your heart and mind in great shape.

## Sleep

Sleep when you can is one of the rules of residency. If you can nap, nap. Even during the day, if you can spare half an hour, try to go to your call room for a power nap. In the middle of the night, no one will beg you to go to bed but still, the rule applies.

The next day, I always tried to get a few hours of sleep, but I would put my alarm a few hours later so I had time to have diner and exercise a little before going back to bed to get ready for the next day. With the new duty hour rules, this may change but the gestalt remains the same.

## Social

Having a social life during residency can be a foreign concept for many, but it’s important! When a group of resident organise an evening out, go, even if you’d rather stay home and watch TV. On top of clearing your mind, you will get to know your colleagues differently. This special rapport will carry on in the hospital and will make your job easier as well. Win-win situation. 

## Mind

The “social wellbeing” part of the WHO health definition is often overlooked, unfortunately. Residency is notorious for sleep deprivation and difficult working conditions. High expectations we set for ourselves are another source of worries. That can lead to important mental health issues.

About six month in my first year of residency, I had enough. I just finished two blocks of general internal medicine and was now on gen sure with 1 in 4 calls. On top of that, it was Christmas time and the medical students were away. I was covering for all three gen sure teams and doing floor and emerge consults. (I had good help from my seniors though, I must say. I’ll always remember the night Dave Robertson brought me a Starbucks coffee. I almost cried of joy) Anyhow, I realised I was getting tired mentally. I just couldn’t give anymore. Fortunately I had a few days off over New Year to recharge the batteries, but they were really low and it took me a while before I felt “back to normal”. I often wondered if I was clinically depressed at that time, but I don’t think so. However, that episode made me realise how dangerous work can be for our mental health.

I personally find sports to be of much help for my mental wellbeing. Other find that practicing mindfulness [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness) is best for them. Mindfulness has gained momentum over the last few years, especially in medical schools. Many offer free classes and I recommend attending them. A good tip I’ve read somewhere is to practice mindfulness when your pager beeps.

If you ask an older attending what makes a good resident, they will likely tell you “someone to know when to ask for help”. I believe that applies to everything in residency, including yourself. Even if you’re feeling fine right now, I recommend at least knowing what resources are available in your centre.

## Suicide

Suicide is the number one killer of young physicians. Here’s a very good list of the whys [http://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/why-physicians-commit-suicide/](http://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/why-physicians-commit-suicide/) with a corresponding TEDx talk [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cvHgGM-cRI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cvHgGM-cRI) I’ve been indirectly affected by resident suicide and obviously this leaves a mark. This is a touching article on the the suicide of that family medicine resident.

This is another, more recent one: [http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/why-do-doctors-commit-suicide.html?_r=1&referrer=](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/why-do-doctors-commit-suicide.html?_r=1&referrer=) If you’re thinking about killing yourself, please get some help. A mentor, program director, suicide helpline… There is help.

(Here, I would like to get the suicide helpline number of as many resident association’s suicide helpline. Most of them have something available; at least in Canada)

There’s been some debate around the root cause of this tendency we have to kill ourselves. Some believe it’s due to the unrealistic expectations (patient care, calls…) combined with physician’s tendency to be perfectionist, therefore not accepting the fact that we just can’t do it all. They say the solution is to re-think the residency training to allow more time to study and do extracurricular activities. I disagree; this is not only very unlikely to change anything (in my mind), but it would only push the problem to a later date. Everything does not magically get better when you’re an attending — it often gets worse. We’re always going to be evaluated (yearly “productivity” reviews) and we’re probably always going to be taking exams (maintenance of certification).

Obviously the problem is very complex and there’s never going to be “one” solution, but one part of the answer probably lies in stress coping techniques, ideally starting when kids are young so we’re not trying to play catch up with stress management skills in med school. This will never solve all the mental health problem that plague us, but it would be a good start.
