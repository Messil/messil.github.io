Teaching is part of a resident’s role. It’s also part of a practicing physician’s role — even those not working in academic centres. Unfortunately, it’s a topic very often overlooked in medical school. All of a sudden, you’re expected to teach (as well as take care of a long list of patients, read and write papers, live a healthy, balanced life… anyways…). Here’s a few tips to get you going.

## Create a friendly environment.

This goes without saying, but medicine in general is a field well known for an archaic hierarchy system. Be nice and others will be nice to you. Grilling is so 1992.

## Identify goals and audience.

You have to adjust your teaching to your audience. Try your best to picture yourself at the level of the learner. Remember when a CT scan was as mysterious as an abstract painting? Remember; always remember.

## Have topics to teach on the fly.

Pro tip: when you give a formal presentation, just after you’re done, scribble a few teaching points and approaches. This can come in handy when you’re asked last minute to teach junior residents or medical students.

## Powerpoint.

That’s an opinion. I dislike Powerpoint presentations. The best teaching sessions I received as a resident were the ones where we saw a patient and ran through the issues and teaching points on the white board. Canned presentations are usually very boring. The drawback here is that you have to be really comfortable with the topic. Slides are a good way to hide a lack of true understanding…

## Short and sweet.

The other day I was sitting in the staff room when the urology people walked in and started an hour long teaching session. That was on a Friday. At 6PM. Come on guys. 

Aim for 15 minutes (unless a schedule has been assigned) and keep track of time. Stop when your time limit is over, even if your topic is “super interesting”

## Summarise.

When you’re done, try your best to summarise the topic in one sentence. Not easy, but being able to summarise a topic on the spot is a super useful skill to develop as a physician. Plus it will help you create better Tweets to help with your social media skills.

One minute preceptor. Because teaching is most often seamless, happening in the hallway or just after you saw the patient.
