As with teaching, giving constructive feedback is an important skill to gain. Here are a few tips to make it easier. As a bonus, it’s an acronym. We all like acronyms!<!--more-->

## **F**requent.

We’ve all heard stories of someone going through a rotation “smoothly” and on the last day, they get a terrifically poor evaluation. Frequent feedback will allow the student to adjust to your style and improve.

## **E**xpected.

Start a rotation clearly stating that you will give feedback to your students.

## **E**xplicit.

Try your best to give feedback on specific behaviours. No general statement such as, “your performance is not adequate”.

## **D**irectly observed.

Give feedback about things you’ve witnessed. Let others provide their own feedback, especially if it’s “constructive”.

## **B**alanced.

Get the learner’s perspective on the situation. Their point of view is important as well!

## **A**ction.

Provide a plan for improvement.

## **C**lear.

Communicate the goals and objectives for which you’ll evaluate the learner.

## **K**ind.

Respect brings respect. You may be in a position of authority, but that’s not a license to be an @$?hole.
