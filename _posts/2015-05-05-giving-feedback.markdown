As with teaching, giving constructive feedback is an important skill to gain. Here’s a few tips to make it easier. As a bonus, it’s an acronym. We all like acronyms!

## Frequent.

We’ve all heard stories of someone going through a rotation “smoothly” and on the last day they get a super bad evaluation. Frequent feedback will allow the student to adjust to your style and improve.

## Expected.

Start a rotation clearly stating you will give feedback to your students.

## Explicit.

Try your best to give feedback on specific behaviours. No general statement like “your performance is not adequate”.

## Directly observed.

Give feedback on things you’ve witnessed. Let others provide their own feedback, especially if it’s “constructive”.

## Balanced.

Get the learner’s perspective on the situation. Their point of view is important as well!

## Action.

Provide a plan for improvement.

## Clear.

Communicate the goals and objectives for which you’ll evaluate the learner.

## Kind.

Respect brings respect. You may be in a position of authority, but that’s not a licence to be an @$?hole.
