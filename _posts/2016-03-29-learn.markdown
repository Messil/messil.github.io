It’s been said before, and I’ll say it again. The learning curve, when you’re alone to take care of around a hundred patients, is steep. *Learning by doing* is even truer than ever. Making the best of it is very important.<!--more-->

## Reflective Practice

While you walk to your next challenge, take a second to reflect on how you managed your last patient.

- What did you do that made the encounter positive?
- How could you improve?

More technical

- Does a new differential diagnosis come to mind?
- Is your plan clear enough for everyone involved? (nurses, other residents/attending doctors)

I know, I know. We’re always told to “reflect” on our performance and hearing this gets tiring after a while. What I’m suggesting is easy and quick. No writing involved.

## How about everything else?

That steep learning curve applies not only to the medical aspects of patient care but also to everything else that may be involved - the “extras”.

- You learn to manage teams.
- You learn to communicate with colleagues and other professionals efficiently.
- You learn to teach.

After a few months of doing calls, you’ll realize how important those “extras” really are.
