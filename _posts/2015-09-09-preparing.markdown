Hopefully, unlike me [link at the story](http://messil.github.io/the-story/), you’ll have time to prepare for your first night on call. It can be so stressful that many forget to bring some essentials with them. Here’s a list on what to bring with you.<!--more-->

- Toothbrush, toothpaste. Self explanatory.
- Glasses, contact lens case / cleaner. Your eyes will get dry, I guarantee it. Consider artificial tears.
- Deodorant +/- shower supply. You don’t want to be the smelly one on the wards.
- Food, especially if your hospital doesn’t have a 24h cafeteria. At least have some healthy snacks.
- Confortable shoes.
- Phone charger. Don’t. Forget. Your. Charger.

## Food strategy

Before the big day, make sure you know the operating hours of the cafeteria and snacks places in the hospital. Set an alert on your phone so you don’t miss them. Also, I recommend you look at what’s available in the vending machines. Ask around to know where to get the best coffee.

Check with your fellow residents. In my hospital, we would get together and order out (usually Cambodian food; my favourite). It was always the highlight of the evening. Well worth it.

## Know your way around the hospital

Make sure your ID badge works with the door locking system. Mine didn’t and it lead to an interesting evening. It’s way easier to get that fixed during the day. You also want to know where the call rooms are, how to access that section and which room is yours. You don’t want to walk in someone else’s room in the middle of the night.

If you’re lucky, your seniors will have printed a list of important numbers and contact information. If not, I recommend you take time and gather those just in case. The operator usually have those numbers close by, but it’s more efficient to have them handy.

## Know where to find the information you need

Often, there’s a “secret” on call document being handed over from seniors to juniors. They often contains protocols as well as general advice on how to survive the night. Unfortunately, they usually contain copyrighted material and therefore cannot be mass printed or sold at the bookstore. Try to get your hands on it.

I’ve noticed that the best “first days” kind of information only gets discussed during the first few days of internship - residency. Unfortunately, many off service resident will go through the “tougher” rotations later during the year, after the seniors have stopped going through the “welcome to hell” introduction at the start of the rotation. You’re then left to figure out things by yourself. Instead, take a few minutes to ask them if they have any advice for you and if there’s a “secret book”.

Also ask your seniors where the hospital protocols are located. For example, my hospital had an insulin sliding scale protocol, but the hospital where I did medical school did not. If you’ve never written orders for an insulin sliding scale, you rather not give it a first try at 11PM. Ultimately, the goal is not only to know how to access them, but what is available in your centre so you can prepare better.

I strongly recommend having at least one “on call” book or app on your phone. Make sure you know what it contains and the structure before you start. This shouldn’t take very long, but at 3AM, you’ll want to find what you’re looking for fast. The main advantage of a book is that it won’t run out of batteries (see “charger” in the list above), which is unfortunately still a problem with today’s phones. If you carry a tablet, you’re probably going to be ok. On the other hand, books tend to be heavy. On top of that, I was never able to find one with the type of information I wanted. — That’s in part why I wrote MD on Call. Regardless of the tool you choose, make sure you know how to use it.
