Short intro

## MedCalc

There are many medical calculators on the Appstore. My personal favourite is MedCalc and it’s the one we’ve integrated with our apps. Re-written from the ground up in 2014, it was clearly designed by physicians for physicians. Attention to details and good support with regular updates is the hallmark of the app. On top of that, formulas are clearly referenced with links to Read by QxMD so you can… hum hum… freshen up on the different clinical scores (so you look like a champ during rounds!)

I recommend taking a few minutes creating a “favourite” list with the formulas you plan on using frequently. 

## Lanthier

Lanthier - Practical Guide to Internal Medicine is a personal favourite of mine and I’m sure you can spot the similarities with MD on Call. That’s because I’m responsible for the “app” version of that book *disclaimer*. For those who are not familiar with Lanthier, it’s an internal medicine pocketbook, very popular in the francophone part of Canada. The english edition has been held back by distribution issues, but the app format has allowed it to really take off. 

I really like the bullet point format of the text. It’s not meant to replace UpToDate — It’s different. More succinct, better adapted for the fast paced reality of the clinic or the ward.

As with MD on Call, I recommend setting up the note synchronisation feature of the app. We made it free so you don’t loose your precious notes if you ever loose or break your device. Also, make sure you enable the integration with MedCalc for easy access to the recommended formulas from within Lanthier

## UpToDate

The classic. I started using UpToDate back when I was in fourth year medical school. I wasn’t a huge fan of the app when it first came out, but it’s gotten better. I still prefer using it on my iPad because of the long texts are better suited for the bigger screen. Now that the iPhone 6 Plus is out that may change.

## Evernote

I’m writing this on Evernote. I studied for my board exams using Evernote. Why? Well, it’s the closest one can be from quickly being able to easily create an app from their personal notes. 

Evernote syncs your notes in real time across all your devices (including your laptop). You can attach pretty much any type of file to your note, search them, reorganise them…

The service is free for a “basic” account. The Premium account benefits [http://evernote.com/premium/](http://evernote.com/premium/) changes from time to time, but for me, the ability to work offline is the best feature of the Premium upgrade. — Especially good for hospital basements.

Michael Hyatt wrote some good blog posts on how to work with Evernote. [http://michaelhyatt.com/how-to-organize-evernote-for-maximum-efficiency.html](http://michaelhyatt.com/how-to-organize-evernote-for-maximum-efficiency.html)

iMedicalApps did something similar but less extensive (but more medically focused — although it’s getting old…) [http://www.imedicalapps.com/2012/06/medical-professionals-evernote-app-productivity-learning-mobile/](http://www.imedicalapps.com/2012/06/medical-professionals-evernote-app-productivity-learning-mobile/)

I strongly recommend *NOT* taking patient notes using Evernote. It’s not HIPAA compliant and could get you in trouble if there’s ever a security breach.

Other apps offers similar features, such as Microsoft OneNote [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/ and Simplenote http://simplenote.com/](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/). I haven’t played around with them so I can’t comment on their functionalities.

## Procedure apps

Let’s face it: we all YouTube’d procedures we were not familiar with. It makes medical educators cringe, but it’s real life. RealWorld Procedure [https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/realworld-procedures/id599417830?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/realworld-procedures/id599417830?mt=8) is a good place to start instead of the ’Tube for general procedures. It’s based on the PocketSnipProdedural Skill Project (PocketSnips.org) so at least you know the information is backed and produced by multiple Faculty of Medicine. Great content, all for free.

## Medication app

There are two better known players in that field. Epocrates and Micromedex. There are many others, but I’ve never seen anyone use them. I’m personally not a huge fan of either as their user interfaces are lacking, but I tend to gravitate back to Epocrates. Epocrates is technically free and Micromedex just recently started charging $2.99 for the app. Both apps sell some of your information such as specialty or browsing history to pharmas which is something people need to be aware of. [http://www.imedicalapps.com/2011/06/hidden-costs-favorite-free-medical-apps-part-1/](http://www.imedicalapps.com/2011/06/hidden-costs-favorite-free-medical-apps-part-1/) . Overall, it’s not my favourite business model, but people have to understand that putting all that information together costs a lot of money and they run a business. This tweet from @isaiah sums it: worth saying again: either you pay for a service, or it’s selling you. there really isn’t a third option.

I recommend downloading both and deciding which one you prefer. $2.99 for Micromedex is not a lot compared to that hard cover copy of Harrison’s you’re using as a doorstop.

## Read vs DocWise

Those apps will allow you to stay updated on the latest literature. They essentially act like a FlipBoard for medical literature. I especially like the fact that they allow you to connect to your hospital or university’s library VPN so you can easily download the papers to your device. For internal medicine people I recommend you check out Panther’s references (available on Read as a public collection). They’re updated regularly with the papers Dr Lanthier uses to update his app. I also enjoy getting their emails highlighting the “most read papers in your field”.

Read is more focused on papers. DocWise also connects to medical news source. Each have interesting features and are rapidly evolving. They’re both free so I recommend you them up and play around with them.

Here’s a nice blog article comparing the two [http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/user-defined-tags/medical-journals/docwise-vs-read-qxmd-which-medical-journal](http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/user-defined-tags/medical-journals/docwise-vs-read-qxmd-which-medical-journal)

## Siri, reminder, task lists…

I like using Siri to set reminders for things like checking bloodworm and converting units. 

There are tons of apps for managing lists. My personal favourite is Clear. It’s simple, elegant and syncs via iCloud with the Mac, iPhone and iPad client.
