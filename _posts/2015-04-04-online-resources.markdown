MD on Call and Lanthier are good tools to get you going, but residency is not just medical; it’s also everything else around the medicine. Learning, teaching, preparing for your own practice… Here’s a list of resources I came across that may be of interest to fans of our apps.

No need for introduction. This site was around before I started medical school and was already popular back then. Lots of helpful advice and an active forum.

Everyone should know Reddit, the best site ever to waste precious time looking at pictures of cute kittens and great memes. But Reddit also has an active medical community, with a subredit dedicated to residents. It’s a good forum for asking people about things

ECG library, procedure videos, podcast… A site I wish I would have put together. The content’s quality is outstanding, all for free

Next level in ECG interpretation. A cardiology keener’s dream coming true.

For ER people. Not just for board exam review.

NEJM procedure video database. What more to say.

CXR atlas. We added X-ray examples to the newest version of MD on Call to allow the user to quickly have access to clinically meaningful X-rays, but sometimes, we want to study using a complete library, and this is the best I found. It hasn’t been updated since 2006, but let’s face it… X-rays haven’t changed much in a little while, so I assume it’s still current.
