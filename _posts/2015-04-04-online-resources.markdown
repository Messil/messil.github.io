MD on Call and Lanthier are good tools to use to get started, but residency is not just medical; it’s also everything else around medicine. Learning, teaching, preparing for your own practice. Here’s a list of resources I came across that may be of interest to fans of our apps.<!--more-->

[Studentdoctor.net](http://www.studentdoctor.net/) No need for introduction. This site was around before I started medical school and was already popular back then. Lots of helpful advice and an active forum.

[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/residency) Everyone should know Reddit, the best site ever to waste precious time looking at pictures of cute kittens and great memes. However, Reddit also has an active medical community, with a sub-reddit dedicated to residents  (/r/residency). It’s a good forum for asking people about things you don’t otherwise want to ask people you know.

[Life In The Fastlane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/) ECG library, procedure videos, podcast… A site I wish I had put together. The quality of the content is outstanding, all for free.

[Dr. Smith's ECG Blog](http://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.ca/) Next level in ECG interpretation. A cardiology keener’s dream come true.

[NEJM procedure video database](http://www.nejm.org/multimedia/medical-videos) What more is there to say?

[CXR atlas](http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/meded/medicine/pulmonar/cxr/atlas/cxratlas_f.htm) We added X-ray examples to the newest version of MD on Call to allow the user to have access to clinically meaningful X-rays quickly, but sometimes, we want to study using a complete library, and this is the best I have found. It hasn’t been updated since 2006, but let’s face it… X-rays haven’t changed much, so I assume it’s still current.

Have a good website to add to this list? Send me an email.
