                    <h3>WHO IS THIS APP DESIGNED FOR?</h3>
                    <p>It is designed for senior medical students,
                        interns or junior residents (or anything that
                        comes immediately after med school in your country).
                        It makes the assumption that you have good general
                        medical knowledge. It applies commonly used medical
                        abbreviations / acronyms to lighten the text.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>ARE THERE ANY ACTIVATION OR RENEWAL FEES?</h3>
                    <p>No. You buy it and it’s yours (unlike some
                        other popular medical resources…)</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>DO YOU PLAN ON UPDATING IT?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Updates will always be free.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>IS THE INFORMATION PEER REVIEWED?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. We do our best to provide accurate
                        medical information. If you find any errors
                        in the text, email us and
                        we’ll do our best to correct it ASAP. </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>I BOUGHT THE IOS VERSION OF THE APP AND I
                        JUST BOUGHT A NEW ANDROID DEVICE
                        (OR VICE-VERSA); DO I NEED TO BUY THE APP AGAIN?</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately, there is no way of transferring
                        platforms without paying for the app again.</p>
